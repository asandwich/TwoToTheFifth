Obfuscated_Health
=================
Obfuscated Java program that does some stuff. Import the project into Eclipse and run the only 'main' method. Or compile and run via, 
```
cd <RepositoryDirectory>/Obfuscated_Health/src/
javac Obfuscated_Health.java
java Obfuscated_Health
```

Being Java, it's difficult to obfuscate. Check out the first post [here](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/28786/write-a-program-that-makes-2-2-5) for the insperation and explination into the project. 


**Built and developed with with Java 8, but should work just fine with Java 7.
